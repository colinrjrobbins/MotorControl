# MotorControl
Used to test and control motors with the raspberry pi GPIO

## Concept

Really simple way to test to make sure motors that I have sitting around are functioning correctly, both the GUI and the CLI applications are the exact same aside from one having a graphical interface. Testing PWM, direction and emergency stop.
